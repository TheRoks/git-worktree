# Welcome to [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)!

To start the slide show:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev`
- visit <http://localhost:3030>

## Building for export

- `pnpm build`

The new `postinstall` script downloads Playwright's Chromium binary so Slidev can export slides without further setup.

Edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes.

Learn more about Slidev at the [documentation](https://sli.dev/).
